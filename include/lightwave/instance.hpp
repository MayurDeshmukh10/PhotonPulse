/**
 * @brief An instance represents an instantiation of a @ref Shape in your scene, and binds materials and a transformation to it.
 * Wrapping a shape like this might seem cumbersome (why not add materials or transforms to the Shape class itself instead?), but allows
 * for more flexibility and efficiency when building scenes. Most notably, you could load a complex triangle mesh (e.g., a tree) once,
 * and render an entire forest by instantiating it with different transformations, without increasing loading time or memory consumption.
 * 
 * @note Instances can be used anywhere shapes can be used, and only differ in that they augment the intersect method of the wrapped shape
 * (namely by applying an optional transform before intersecting the wrapped object, and by populating the instance field).
